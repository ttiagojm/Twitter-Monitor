Make your Twitter a better place unfollowing people and following other people ... automatically

# Create a Twiiter App
To use this collection of scripts you need to have:
- Consumer tokens
- Access Tokens

To get those you need to go [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en) and apply to a Twitter Developer account (normally is fast).
Then you just need to create an app and finally get the tokens.

# How to run
All you need is to:
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
- Place your tokens on that file
- Install requirements.txt: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Execute `main.py`: `python main.py`


**Note**: ***You will need Python 3 to run.***
